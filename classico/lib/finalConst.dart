void main(){
  print("welcome to dart");


  // use of final
  final name = "Raman";

  // cannot ressign name due to final keyword
  name = "Ramnujan";
  // final can be written with any data type expect var
  // final string name1;
  // final var name2; because var is especially made to be overwritten



  // use of const
  const name3 = "Ramani";
  name3 = "Anjali";
  // when we use const be can only initialized in inline

  const name = "Raman";
  name = "Ajay";

  // final and const are same in functionality the difference is that
  // final datatype can be changed or added deleted edited but const cannot be altered the values of const remain constant.

  // that is why if you dont want to edit the values then const can be used
