So, hello everyone and I am of Softwarica batch 30A and this video is of assignment of 5th semester given by Kiran Rana sire who is our mobile application development module leader. And in this video I will be going through some question which was provided by our sir in lab1 and lab2 of schoolworkspro . So, let me show you the questions.so these are the questions of lab1 and these are the questions of lab2 so in this video first I will explain all the question one by one not serially they maybe random i will explain each of the question one by one but first lab 1 and the after that lab2 so lets start. So, if you are watching the video properly then you can see that there are altogether 17 questions in lab1 and lab2 both combined there are like 17 question. first i will go to lab1 and i will execute each of these nine questions one by one so lets sat with vowelconsoant first i will go to the terminal lets wait for the termnal to load its taking a bit of time to load. There is the terminal and now lets start to execute our dart program

I had to go inside lab1 file inorder to access vowelconsonant filenow i am inside the lab1 directory you can see, you can see its working so this program to print vowel consonant is working so in the same manner i will execute one by one each of these program and i will try to talk les lets start unfortunantely the laptop is getting slower so its taking time there is a half a second delay while typing. So, you can see the second program was also executed successfully so ets go to the next program as you can see this program was to print all the numbers from 1 to 100 but except 41 as you can see the condition iside the for loop. So, this was supposed to be multplication of 5 but it seems to be executing all the tables file. Its because i gave the wrong dart file so this worked just right now so now i will execute this multiplication table dot dart so it will give multiplication of 5 oh it didnt gave anything because no function was called now let be save it and re run it again as you can see.now we are in lab2 so now i will execute these eight questions one by one so now this time lets satrt with the first question i will clear this terminal lets get outside the lab1 directory and get inside the lab2 now i will execute one by one all of the dart files so this was a program which has a list and this program has a function which searches for the name which has letter a in the begining as you can see the function is here now lets go to next program this program is to crate a set of fruits and print all of them as you can see so this looks like a program which basically creates a map and prints all items inside the map so basically whta is done is that to add anything to a map we need to give a specific index and specific key and a value to the map so this statement was written inisde a function a functin was made for every key value pair you can see here and a function was made to return key value pair which has length four let me run it now lets go to the next this function was to make a map and just set the values inside the map as you can see its pretty simple all the programs are simple of lab1 and lab2 sunday monday tuesday wednesy day and friday oh i gave the spelling worng it works lets get to the next question so it will just basically print a list opps let me just re run it again now this is a todo program which just has three task one is add and onw is to remove and one is to view as you can see the functions are also really simple and they are called in the man function using a switch case so let me run it for you so i want to add a task so i wan to add a new task named code mern app by 12th so now if i type view you can see the contents are getting stored lets get to another app so this program basically takes expenses of a person as input and what it does is that it prints total expense done by that person so let me run it for you now i will start to add expenses to this list and i spent like 1200 and yesterday i spent like 400 and day before yesterday i spent like more than 4500 so lets calculate this amount as you can see the total expense is also working thankyou that was it.
